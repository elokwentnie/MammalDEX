# MammalDEX
MammalDex is an application that allows users to discover, track, and record sightings of mammals. Initially focused on safari animals in Kenya and Tanzania, it will eventually expand to include mammals from around the world. Users can browse species by location, learn detailed information about each mammal, and maintain personal collections of sightings. Over time, MammalDex will provide rich statistics and visualizations, and offer both free and premium features, including image-based species identification.

## Features
* Species Information: Learn about the mammal’s name, Latin name, size, lifespan, diet, habitat, and more.
* Location-Based Filtering: See which mammals can be found in a specific region or the entire country.
* User Collection: Track which species you’ve seen and discover what’s still missing from your list.
* Statistics & Dashboards: Review your progress by region, country, continent, or globally.
* Free & Premium Options:

  * Premium: AI-based photo identification and multiple images per species.

## Technology
* Backend: Django (Python)
